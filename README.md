## Introduction

This repository is crafted to assist learners in implementing both basic and advanced Data Structures and Algorithms using Python. Each implementation is designed for clarity and simplicity, adhering to standard Python coding conventions.

In addition to code, you will find comprehensive explanations for each data structure and algorithm, including their time and space complexities.

## List of Data Structures and Algorithms

Below is a list of the Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in this repository:

1. **Array**: Operations such as insert, delete, search, etc.
2. **Linked List**: Singly Linked List with operations like insert, delete, reverse, and search.
3. **Stack**: Operations including push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.
4. **Queue**: Includes enqueue, dequeue, peek, and isEmpty operations.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Functions for insert, search, delete, findMin, and findMax.
6. **Hash Table**: Operations for insert, search, delete, resize, and hash function.
7. **Heap (Min/Max)**: Functions for insert, extract min/max, peek, delete, and heapify.
8. **Graph**: Methods for adding vertices/edges, DFS, BFS, and removing vertices.
9. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Operations for insert, search, delete, startsWith, and display.
10. **Dynamic Programming**: Solutions for Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence (LCS), and knapsack problem.

Each implementation includes a corresponding Python file (`.py`) along with a markdown file (`.md`) that explains the concept in detail, discusses operations and complexities, and provides example usage.
