## Introduction

This repository is designed to help anyone learn and implement basic to advanced Data Structures and Algorithms in Python. Each implementation is structured to be simple and easily understandable, following standard conventions for Python coding practices.

It includes explanations for each data structure and algorithm, along with their respective time and space complexities.

## List of Data Structures and Algorithms

Here is the list of Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in this repository:

1. **Array**: Operations like insert, delete, search, and more.
2. **Linked List**: Singly Linked List, operations like insert, delete, reverse, and search.
3. **Stack**: Push, pop, peek, isEmpty operations.
4. **Queue**: Enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty operations.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Insert, search, delete, findMin, findMax operations.
6. **Hash Table**: Insert, search, delete, resize, hash function.
7. **Heap (Min/Max)**: Insert, extract min/max, peek, delete, heapify.
8. **Graph**: Add vertex, add edge, DFS, BFS, remove vertex.
9. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**: Insert, search, delete, startsWith, display.
10. **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci sequence, longest common subsequence (LCS), knapsack problem.

Each implementation is accompanied by a Python file (`.py`) and a markdown file (`.md`) which explains the concept, operations, complexities, and provides example usage.
